<h1 align="center">Hello</h1>

<div class="container">
  <div>
    My name is David Kim, an M.Eng. student in Computer Science. I love coding
    to create apps and other various useful things that people can use on a
    daily basis. In my free time, I enjoy biking and playing board games with
    friends.
